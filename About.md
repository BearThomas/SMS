>This file is the introduction about the project. I'm a Chinese student (When I create the Project, I'm only 13 years old!), and not good at English, so if I have some express is bad, you can tell me 🙂

# Why I start this project
In China, many schools (or classes) use app "Class optimization master" to menage the student. But it has some weak side. For example it cannot diy the deduct points, and some tools need money. So I want to create a special app, School Menage System (SMS).

# What the app look like in my mind
First, it has very good customizability, can use the logo of the class and make the interface more clean and useful.

Next, it has some good tools, they are useful.

Finally, I really can't think of anything else to say.
# When can I finish
Becase of the school work, I can't say exactly when it's done. (Sorry)
